              A personal injury attorney and our longest-running lawyer partnership. When we started, he had a small
              following and was known mostly within his professional network. Today the brand runs a second lead
              channel that has nothing to do with a lead form. A referral network so large he refers out the cases
              he can't take, and those attorneys refer back.
